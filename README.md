<h3>evilginx.botguard 2: JavaScript Boogaloo</h3>

## The Sequel Nobody Asked For, But Desperately Needed

> *Remember the good ol' days when you could snag user credentials with a simple MITM phishing tool? When Google's anti-bot systems were more like a polite suggestion than a digital fortress? Yeah, those days are gone. Welcome to the wild world of JavaScript-fueled login paranoia.*

But fear not, my fellow phishing enthusiasts! While we can't turn back the clock, we can shimmy our way back into Google's inner circle with... **evilginx.botguard 2!**



### Features (If You Can Call Them That)

- **Headless Browser Wrangling**: We'll dance the delicate tango with headless browsers to coax out those precious, legitimate botguard tokens. It's like teaching an elephant to waltz; awkward, occasionally destructive, but **strangely effective**.
- **Token Swapping Shenanigans**: Think of it as the ultimate sleight of hand. We'll ditch those bogus tokens and slip in the real deal, all while whispering sweet nothings to Google's JavaScript overlords.
- **Error Messages Galore**: Get ready for a symphony of cryptic JavaScript errors! It's the **soundtrack of our struggle**, a testament to the absurdity of modern web security.
- **AST Parsing Mischief**: Buckle up for some tree-climbing adventures, folks! We're dissecting JavaScript code with the precision of a surgeon to pinpoint exactly where those pesky location calls try to hide.
- **JavaScript Global Property Hijinks**: We're going full-on Succession-style **puppet masters** with JavaScript's global properties (and with of course our **Monkey Wrench**). Think mind control for browser variables, bending them to our will and defying expectations.
### Disclaimer

- May induce **spontaneous outbursts** of laughter, existential despair, or a potent combination of both.
- Success rates are directly proportional to Google's ever-changing whims. It's like playing whack-a-mole with a **constantly morphing mole**.
- Not for the faint of heart or those allergic to convoluted JavaScript workarounds.
